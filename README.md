# complex-networks
Following files represent a set of script designed for a complete study of the study of Online Social Networking (OSN) services. The study consists in:

  1) A full read and characterization of the underlying social network
    
      - For this section, once started the program will ask the name of the network file containing the topology. Once introduced it will store the relevant information and summarize the network features through the terminal. The network file needs to be written as an edge list, i.e. two columns where the elements of each row are the vertex forming a link.
  
Then depending on the feature that the user wants to study it is necessary to refer to different sub-scripts:

  2) Take Over
  3) Coexistence
  4) Topology
  5) Computational Time

All sub-scripts use the same functions.c script for the functions and needs to be accordingly compiled.
